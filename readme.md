## Overview

This repository contains the simulation code and analysis scripts used in the paper.  
It includes simulations for convergence rates, plug-in estimations, and the data application using imaging mediators.

##  Folder Structure

- **Project folders:** 
  - `./1-convergence/`: simulations for convergence rates. 
  - `./2-plugin/`: simulations for plug-in estimations. 
  - `./3-imaging_application/ `: data application using imaging mediators. 

- `./figure/` and `./table/` contain the figures and tables used in the manuscript, generated by the respective `summarize_results.R` script in each of the three folders above using corresponding outputs.
- `renv.lock`: version control. To regenerate outputs, it is recommended to use ```renv::restore()``` to install the exact R package versions used in simulations to `./renv/`. Key packages include`sl3`, `hal9001`, etc.

## Authorship and Contributions

This project was developed jointly as part of our collaborative research. Simulations for convergence rates are adapted from code initially written by Wenxin Zhang, used here with their permission.
